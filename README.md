# MA5953 - Creating Your Own Data: Web Scraping &amp; Text Mining

## Course Introduction

The course provides an introduction to different methods on how to create data. Specifically, the module will teach you how to scrape data from the web and conduct text analysis using some of the most common methods of supervised and unsupervised classification. 

### Assessment

You will have to scrape tweets from 2 politicians of your choice and carry out either a sentiment analysis or a topic model analysis. The 1,000 words report will include descriptives of the text data scraped, explanation of the text mining method chosen, and a presentation of the core results. You will need to submit your R script in addition (the R script does not count towards the word limit). 

### Requirements

You need to have installed the most up-to-date versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org) and  [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Prior knowledge of R is a must, make sure you understand the language basics (packages, objects/vectors, core functions and vector + data management operations), and that you know how to trouble-shoot errors and install packages.

### Course Structure

The course will have weekly lectures and computer labs. The lecture will introduce the core concepts and the relevant R code for the week whereas the computer lab provides an opportunity for students to flag issues / ask questions about the lecture, the code, and the problem set. It is highly recommended that you attend the lecture/watch the lecture videos for the relevant week and practice with the problem set *before* the computer lab, to exploit the Q&A session to the fullest. The lab will also feature applied group work exercises.
