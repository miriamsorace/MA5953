# MA5953 - Creating Your Own Data: Web Scraping &amp; Text Mining

## Course Introduction

The course provides an introduction to different methods on how to create data. Specifically, the module will teach you how to scrape data from the web and conduct text analysis using some of the most common methods of supervised and unsupervised classification. 

### Assessment

You will have to scrape tweets from 2 politicians of your choice and carry out either a sentiment analysis or a topic model analysis. The 1,000 words report will include descriptives of the text data scraped, explanation of the text mining method chosen, and a presentation of the core results. You will need to submit your R script in addition (the R script does not count towards the word limit). 

### Requirements

You need to have installed the most up-to-date versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org) and  [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Prior knowledge of R is a must, make sure you understand the language basics (packages, objects/vectors, core functions and vector + data management operations), and that you know how to trouble-shoot errors and install packages.

### Course Structure

The course will have weekly lectures and computer labs. The lecture will introduce the core concepts and the relevant R code for the week whereas the computer lab provides an opportunity for students to flag issues / ask questions about the lecture, the code, and the problem set. It is highly recommended that you attend the lecture/watch the lecture videos for the relevant week and practice with the problem set *before* the computer lab, to exploit the Q&A session to the fullest. The lab will also feature applied group work exercises.


## Detailed Course Schedule

### Class 1: Data Science – Data Collection Strategies & Primer on Web Technologies

This class will introduce you to data science, best practices in data collection and management as well as the most important markup languages that form the building blocks of websites and web applications - i.e.  HTML, XML, and JSON. The class will introduce web scraping via an applied example on endangered cultural and natural sites. Data on such sites will be scraped from Wikipedia and then visualised using maps and histograms.

In the problem set and computer lab, we will practice with the Element Inspector and HTML tags. We will manually reproduce a webpage using HTML tags and also reproduce the endangered sites analysis from the lecture.

### Class 2: Web Scraping & Regular Expressions

This class will introduce you to webscraping from static webpages. Dynamic webpage scraping will also be briefly introduced. You will learn about node query scraping, scraping via regular expressions, and scraping via APIs. You will then learn how to parse webpages, scrape tables, texts and links using R. You will also learn how to loop over URL lists and/or lists of links to scrape multiple webpages at once. 

In the problem set and computer lab, we will practice with the code introduced in the lecture and will do a practical exercise which will entail scraping and cleaning Covid data for several countries from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
